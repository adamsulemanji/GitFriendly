This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the download the project and run the following command to install the dependencies and prepare the project:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

To run just the frontend, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run the backend, run the following command:

```bash
npm run flask
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) with your browser to see the result.

To run both the frontend and backend, run the following command:

```bash
npm run slay
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
